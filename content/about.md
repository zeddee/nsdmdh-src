## Experience

### Ground Labs 

#### Technical Writer (Feb, 2016 – Present)

- Manage and write technical content.
- Develop and maintain technical writing toolset.
- Manage the technical documentation team.

I manage the technical documentation team at Ground Labs, where we develop and maintain various technical documents. The team's core responsibility is developing and maintaining end-user and developer-facing documentation for our the company's products. Because we are embedded in the engineering team, we work closely together with our developers and are part of the AGILE development cycle.

#### Achievements

- **Developed end-user documentation** for three products from ground up.
- **Develop and maintain documentation toolchains**.
  - Confluence
  - MadCap Flare 2017
  - Sphinx (in development)
- **Docs-as-code**. By shifting our documentation platform from Confluence to Flare, we were able to use Git to manage our content, and allow us to:
  - Collaborate over Bitbucket within the documentation team and with developers.
  - Set up an automated build toolchain for Flare.
  - Strengthens the documentation team's legitimacy as a member of the engineering team.
  - Future plans with Sphinx would move our entire editing and review workflow onto Bitbucket, allowing developers and other subject matter experts to review content on the platform they are already reviewing code on.
- **Expanded documentation team**.
  - We are always looking for new things to document, and ways to improve information flows in the company.
  - In order to do that, we have to constantly expanding and finding force multipliers in the form of effective tools to scale the output of the documentation team as the company grows.
- **Insert the documentation team into the feature design process**.
  - The documentation team here serves as a useful litmus test for how user-friendly a feature is.
  - As the feature is being designed, we have insight into what would make for complicated documentation, which usually indicates poor user experience.
  - Being present at the feature design process allows us to help mitigate these issues.
  - In addition, we would be able to scope out the amount of work — research and writing — required for the feature.
- **Co-ordinated team of freelancers for research project**.
  - Hired and co-ordinated 20 freelancers across the world for an internal research project,
  - Collected, managed, and organised information collected from freelancers for use in development work.

#### Peripheral responsibilities

- **Informal knowledge management**. No formal knowledge management processes. The documentation team monitors and collects a large amount of information during our course of work, so we try and informally facilitate the communication, recording, and organisation of information as we encounter it.
- **UI text**. We write UI text where needed.
- **Feature Research**. Some features require a significant amount of research before development work can start. We provide research help where appropriate, and where we may be able to provide domain expertise.

### Adjunct Instructor, Various Institutions

#### Institutions

- Interior Design, Singapore Polytechnic School of Design
  - Adjunct Instructor, Theory of Design, Apr 2014 – Mar 2016

  - Guest Lecturer, Game Narrative, 18 Oct 2016

As an adjunct instructor, I developed my own classroom materials and curriculum and delivered lectures and tutorials, across a range of topics. Because the courses that I teach tend towards the open-ended, I designed my classes to be exploratory, teaching students to develop questions rather than focusing on answers. 

#### Core Responsibilities

- Curriculum development
- Classroom management
- Pedagogical methods
- Editorial (i.e. grading essays)
- Test design
