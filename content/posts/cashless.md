I've been observing the wailing and gnashing of teeth over how we can never be a smart nation if we're behind in the adoption of cashless systems. Aside from the usual "you're going to get hacked by an NFC scanner" trains of thought, these points come to mind:

- I understand that the original complaint is about the exorbitant fees that payment merchants charge for cashless transactions. This is the thing that hampers wide adoption of cashless payments, and not the tech or lack thereof.
- "Smart Nations" and "Smart Cities" do not need to go cashless.
  - Cashless adoption is merely a facet of the digitasation of how we live. We never see the physical form of all the money in our bank accounts.
  - Nobody properly knows what a "Smart Nation" is. It seems to be a mess of digital technologies with the vague aim of "digitising" everything -- that everything must be tracked and must have an API. There are benefits and dangers to this that are outside the scope of this rant.
  - A "Smart Nation" can very well function with physical cash for brick-and-mortar purchases.
- We surpass Japan in adoption of cashless payments[^1], which stands at 17% as of 2004, and more recently at 19%[^2]. Singapore stands at about 50%[^1]. We look to Japan for many things, but somehow gloss over their reluctance to take on cashless payments.
- Mobile payments. The public is enamoured by this idea that you can pay for everything and anything with your mobile device in China. This is form of cashless payments is under-considered and poses the following issues:
  - Connectivity. You must be connected to the Internet to make mobile payments. Should you run out of data or wifi, you're essentially stranded without money. Should the telco go down, you're stranded without money. Should the store be located for some reason in a faraday cage, you're stranded without money.
  - Intermediaries. Previously, the only intermediaries involved were the banks from whom you got your debit/credit cards. Now, the following (non-exhaustive) are added into the mix:
      - Mobile phone manufacturers.
      - Payment merchants e.g. Paypal, GrabPay etc.
      - Telecommunication companies.
      - Your Internet service provider (may or may not be the same as your telco).
      - The owner of the router supplying your wifi (if applicable).
  - Every additional party added to the "cashless" chain is a security risk.
  - A useful metaphor: treat your mobile device like genitalia -- if you stick it into random receptacles/stick random things into it unprotected, it's going to catch something.
- Payment via QR codes. Can I just express my horror at this idea? Scanning a random QR code that leads you to a payment portal is the equivalent of using a glory hole (please do not google; just bite the bullet and ask someone). Clicking on a dubious link in an email has already been established as an obvious no-no, so why are people excited about scanning QR codes which _do not indicate its contents in any way_? There are ways to secure this i.e. payment apps must restrict input accepted from scanning QR codes etc., but it still requires the user to be savvy (which is never likely, given imperfect knowledge and uneven hardware/software distribution).
- Cryptocurrencies. This may be a viable route, given that (1) it's increasingly regulated, which means that it will become more viable as actual financial infrastructure, and (2) it allows for offline transactions to some extent (you still need to connect your wallet to the Internet to make and confirm a transaction). Estonia[^3], China[^4], and Russia[^5] are looking into digitising their currencies[^6]. But it is still a burgeoning technology, and comes with its own difficulties such as a relatively steep learning/adoption curve, and the regulatory desert it currently exists in.

[^6]: From what I understand, this involves at a basic level using cryptography to serialize money, so that every unit of money issued by the treasury has a digital reference that can be stored, transferred etc.
