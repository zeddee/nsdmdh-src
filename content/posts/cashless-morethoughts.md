Other cashless thoughts:
- hardware wallets
- Bitcoin hardware wallets are basically USB sticks that holds a wallet address and a cryptographic key required to authorise any transactions to and from the wallet. Or you could be using a "brain wallet", which is a wallet encrypted with a pass phrase that you only keep in your brain. 
- Hardware wallets are also very similar to our Cash Cards: uniform pieces of hardware and software. I don't pretend to know a lot about Cash Cards, but I suspect that it's never appeared to have been hacked because (1) it is a distributed store of value, i.e. there is no central exchange to hack (2) it is easier to steal a Cash Card than to hack it (3) I also suspect all value added to the cash card has to be signed with a strong cryptographic key, which makes significantly difficult enough to deter attempting large-scale duplication of Cash Cards (4) limited usefulness. Hacking a cash card would earn you perhaps a year in free parking credits but may also land you in jail for white collar crime. I think most people with the smarts to hack a Cash card would be prudent enough to apply their talents more productively. 
- Hardware wallets will share point 1 with the Cash Cards, and can leverage the following benefits of dedicated hardware that the cash card never seemed to need:
  - uniform platform. 
    - Hardware and software for all hardware wallets should share a strict uniform base. More on thia later. A uniform platform will make sure that software and security updates are compatible with all devices. How these updates can be distributed in a foolproof manner must be specially considered, but this is a start.
    - If the hardware or software is hacked, the wallets are protected by point 1 above. But it also means that a fix for _all_ devices can be found and quickly applied. No fiddling about with hardware compatibility. 
    - if The Central payments network (whatever it is) is hacked, the onus is on the entity that manages that network to shut it down and patch it. Wallets are protected by point 1.
- limited intermediaries.
- Have to ask yourself which is more likely -- the payment merchant getting hacked, misplacing your wallet, or getting hit by climate-change-related force majeure .
