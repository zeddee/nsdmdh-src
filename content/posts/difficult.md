> The Kantian revolution in philosophy is a lesson in limitation. As Pascal said, we are the weakest reed in nature and this fact requires an acknowledgement that is very reluctantly given. Our culture is endlessly beset with Promethean myths of the overcoming of the human condition, whether thorugh the fantasy of artificial intelligence, contemporary delusions about robotics, cloning and genetic manipulation or simply through cryogenics and cosmetic surgery. _We seem to have enormous difficulty in accepting our limitedness, our finiteness_, and this failure is a cause of much tragedy. -- Simon Critchley, _Infinitely Demanding_, Verso 2012 (emphasis mine).

I turned thirty somewhere in the middle of this year. Joey Yap tells me via YouTube video that things will change this year. That's like saying we're all waiting to be stardust, but I'll take what I can get.

Other things that people say will happen when you turn thirty:

- Your finances are set. You've bought a home; retirement's on the cards; your car's been paid for, etc. You've just got to stick it out for another decade and you're good.
- You're getting married; the kid's already here, or a plan you're working towards.
- Your parents are retired; it's your turn to support them now.
- Your lifestyle is sane and productive. Your weekends are reserved for family and friends. You'd hold a barbeque once in a while. Drinks on weekends, coffee for the rest of the week.

I have done none of the above, not because they are not good things to have in one's life (and I am happy for my friends who have gotten life down pat), but because I need to be difficult. I can neither answer the why nor the what of this (god knows my parents have tried). I am, by no means, the most difficult, but nevertheless still difficult -- difficult student, difficult team mate, difficult worker, difficult teacher, difficult lover, difficult brother, difficult son, difficult friend.

I apologize in advance, because I will continue to be difficult.
