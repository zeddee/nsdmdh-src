I turned thirty somewhere in the middle of this year. Joey Yap tells me via YouTube video that things will change this year. That's like saying we're all waiting to be stardust, but I'll take what I can get.

Other things that people say will happen when you turn thirty:

- Your finances are set. You've bought a home; retirement's on the cards; your car's been paid for, etc. You've just got to stick it out for another decade and you're good.
- You're getting married; the kid's already here, or a plan you're working towards.
- Your parents are retired; it's your turn to support them now.
- Your lifestyle is sane and productive. Your weekends are reserved for family and friends. You'd hold a barbeque once in a while. Drinks on weekends, coffee for the rest of the week.

If not already obvious, I have a penchant for difficult things and being difficult. I have done none of the above, not because they are not good things to have in one's life (and I am happy for my friends who have gotten life down pat), but because I need to be difficult. I cannot answer why nor what (re: what do you mean by "difficult"). I am, by no means, the most difficult, but nevertheless still difficult -- difficult student, difficult team mate, difficult worker, difficult teacher, difficult brother, difficult son, difficult friend.

I will continue to be difficult, because I don't know any other way to exist.
