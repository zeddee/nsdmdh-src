My grandma has a mobile phone. For the longest time, she refused to carry one, but eventually relented after endless nagging from her children. But even then, she'd forget to charge it, or forget to carry it entirely (unintentionally or not is a different story). Her issuers even programmed a sort of emergency button for her that, when pressed, would send out the following SMS to the 10 or so different phone numbers of her children: "Help me! Help me!" I found out about the button only because my mum uncharacteristically grabbed my dad's arm during dinner and started panicking, only to discover that grandma had a fat-fingered moment and subsequently received frantic calls from all designated emergency-sms-recipients. Point being: my grandma has a phone, is barely to remember to charge it, finds it a nuisance, and very much prefers using the landline or just walking down to the market to have a conversation.





Premise: Embracing a "cashless society" is not necessary for moving towards a "Smart Nation", but digital money is a future that we have to come to terms with.


If we have to move towards a cashless system, there are a few things that we will have to keep in mind.

First off, assumptions:

- Assumption 1: "Cashless society" does not mean deprecation of physical money. Both should still hold value and be valid as currency.
- Assumption 2: "Cashless society" would rely on one or several parallel systems of digital payments that are not the same as using a credit/debit card. This means that this cashless system would not rely on or be connect to a bank account. I make this distinction because holding physical cash is not the same as value reflected in a bank balance. The former is at hand, the latter is not; the former relies on an agreement between all transacting parties and the national monetary authority, the latter is an agreement between transacting parties and the bank.
- Assumption 3: Cashless transactions will rely on digital money, which may or may not be proprietary tokens (value that may be used in transactions for specific merchants only, e.g. NTUC vouchers that may be exchanged for the printed value in goods at NTUC supermarkets).
- Assumption 4: Digital money is not the same as digital currency. Digital money is value that is stored on a computerised system. Digital currency has to be a form of legal tender, independent of payment merchant, bank, or any other intermediary short of the national monetary authority. I've mentioned briefly how digital currencies are being tested in countries like Russia, China, and Estonia in a previous post (go to post to check out sources). I think Singapore is making similar efforts. 

For a national cashless system, I would like to propose the following principles:

- Must be local. Not necessarily "by Singaporeans, for Singpaoreans" as this veers dangerously to the right, but I agree that the system must be developed by actors who are invested in the long-term effects of such a payment system.
- The system must be accessible. Not in the sense of "ubiquitous", but rather that (1) 

In other words, the system must be an ethical system. Not "ethical" in the sense of "fair trade" or "lawful", but in the following:

- The system must be open. Open in the senses of "open to audit" and "available for use and independent development". This will be the scariest thing for merchants looking to implement the cashless system.
- The system must be based on an agreed-upon standard. This standard should not be diktat, but one that is immutable except by change elected by a steering committee or public vote.
- If a steering committee is to be formed, it should e elected.
