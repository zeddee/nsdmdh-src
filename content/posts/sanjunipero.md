_San Junipero_ made me cry. The fourth episode of the third season of _Black Mirror_ won two Emmy's last month, so I felt that maybe it was time to sit down and watch it. It hit all the right notes, a properly poignant love story in a world where nobody belongs — finding love in a hopeless place, if we are to follow the episode's musical motif.

And having finally watched _San Junipero_, which looks to be the peak of the series, I can say truly that _Black Mirror_ is a mess and its viewers deserve better.

It may not look like it, but lots of things make me cry. Listening to sad songs make me cry. Watching the plotline of an ill-fated relationship unfold makes me cry. Reading about loss makes me cry. Seeing a beautiful film makes me cry. _San Junipero_ made me cry because it was written to hit very specific emotional triggers:

- Joy of discovery: Young person who never finally learns how to live learns how to live.
- Bittersweet discovery: Rebuffed lover discovers that rebuffer is in love with her, but tries to keep distance because Feelings are unecessary.
- Bittersweet redemption: One of you is dying but love wins. You both get married.
- Tragedy: Death of young person (who is actually old person, but never got to live and love)
- Tragedy: There is no time left to love.
- Tragedy: Breakup because Miscommunication. Love is just a word.
- Redemption: Love wins despite.

I don't care if it hits these emotional triggers intentionally or not; all media worth its salt is designed to have a calculated effect on its audience, and if you don't believe that then I wish you a happy life in your little bubble. So no harm done if television marks out a few spots in which it decides to get under my skin.

But what really gets to me is that the world of _San Junipero_ is so unforgivably flat given such a potentially rich premise. You get to upload your brain to a server when you die, where you live out the rest of eternity as your young, unblemished self, wherever and whenever you want to be. After getting past the question of "why the hell would you want to be your human self in a virtual world where everything is constructed out of bytes or whatever futuristic equivalent they have in their world", and pushing past the question of in what world would such an unimaginative alternative to the end-of-life question be acceptable, I still want to ask: How is it that a virtual world populated by people, albeit dead, with nothing to do at all, are portrayed as only desiring and capable of seeking decadent pleasure? How is it that, in a super advanced world, where people are mostly dying of old age bar _force majeure_, are acting like such utter teenagers? Given that they are actually "living" in the world, where are the crafstmen? Where are the shopkeeps? Where are the explorers? The completionists (think _Westworld's_ William) and the trolls? 

Where are all these people? Yorkie asks Kelly how many of _San Junipero_'s inhabitants she thinks are dead, and she says, "80%", but 99% of on-screen behaviour shows them all behaving like NPCS: acting out little loops of habit, homing in on the same source of pleasure again, and again, and again when we are supposed to believe that _San Junipero_ is a legitimate place to go when you die. But it doesn't seem like anyone is truly alive in there. 

It feels like the writers are trying to convince me that this is a living world by telling me over and over again — yes, this world is alive; here are a few throwaway recurring characters who will appear twice but have no impact on the story whatsoever. All the other characters introduced and whom I will never the remember the names of have no impact on the story whatsoever; they were thrown in to give the world a semblence of depth when they barely suffice as plot devices, giving scant rationale for Yorkie's pinballing around _San Junipero_ looking for Kelly. You could as much have Yorkie turn the corner and unexpectedly find Kelly and have equal effect with much less confusion. But there I was watching the episode wondering if one of these characters was hiding a key revelation, or perhaps one say something that would unlock character growth. But no, because the story must be in itself an uncontrollable converging force to bring its two protagonists together, all other things are unimportant. I am upset because Yorkie's and Kelly's story is so beautiful by itself, but is unceremoniously shoved in such a shittily constructed world. 

I want to believe in what is explicitly a positive ending in _San Junipero_, that Yorkie and Kelly are alive somehow in byte land, as two glowing orbs on a server farm that is probably serving as a CPU lake somewhere. But I don't. Not because at the end of the episode, _Black Mirror_ just needs to remind us that it's _Black Mirror_ and all is fine and dandy only if you've joined the Machine Overlord team. I still do see that as hopeful, that I genuinely believe that bytes are material, and if configured correctly can quite possibly be like neural tissue. But the world built around Yorkie and Kelly doesn't make me want to live in it. Heaven is not a place on Earth, if it is a reduction of what we already have on the mortal plane. Heaven is not a place on earth if all I can do is go to the same two shitty bars down the street and customize my outfits. Heaven is not a place on earth if everybody behaves like they have nothing to live for for eternity. Heaven is not a place on earth if I'm going to be bored my first day in.

PS: So I googled "San Junipero". From what I can gather, it may mean "Saint Juniper", the Friar of Puns (according to Wikipedia), or it may refer to the Saint Serra Junipero, killer of Native Americans and self-mutilator. Failure to draw on any of these associations, making the title of the episode and the name of the place (another strike for worldbuilding) utterly of throwaway relevance.
