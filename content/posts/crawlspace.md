"_Zeh_[^1], why do you think that old man sits there all the time?"

"I don't know. You go and ask him."

"Maybe he's waiting for somebody."

"How you know?"

"Don't know. Just look like, only."

"Maybe he just doesn't want to stay at home."

"Why?"

"You go and ask him."

"Don't want."

"Then don't ask me already."

"But I want to know."

"Then go and ask him lah!"

"…"
  
"…"

"He's getting up."

"Okay. I don't want to know."

"No. Look. He's getting up. He's picking up all his newspapers. Maybe he knows that we see him, then he _paiseh_[^2] already."

"Don't tell me."

"He's not picking up his things. All the newspapers and cardboard."

"Stop it."

"Where is he going?"

"Stop."

"I don't know where he is going. Maybe he's headed off to sit somewhere else, where there won't be people like us watching him. Maybe he's going to pee behind that tree, like he sometimes does. Maybe he has a home, and his nest of old papers is just for comfort, just convenient, just a reminder to stay connected to the earth and the world."

"Really meh?"

"I don't know."

"Let's go and see."

_They leave the balcony and scramble down the corridor of the apartment complex, turn right and down a flight of steps. It is noon, and there is one mynah perched on a brown rock. The children don't slow down as they approach the tree. The old man's penis peeks out of his pants, stream of urine tapering off. He doesn't see them as they bum-rush him._

"Oof!"

"Oof!"

_They're all on the ground. The old man is on his side, dampness spreading across the grass, the soil, his pants. He tries to roll._

"He's getting up."

"I know."

"Quick, kick him."

"…"

"…"

"I think can already."

"Let's see."

"What do you think he is carrying?"

"Don't know, leh. See lor."

"Do you think he sees us?"

"Don't know. His eyes are open."

"He's still peeing."

"He's not peeing already."

"Very smelly."

"I know."

"Start here. Peel off that part under his collar bone."

"You do, lah."

"Okay."

"…"

"…"

"We need to get past his ribs."

"I know. You do, lah."

"Okay."

"…"

"…"

"…"

"Cannot. Too hard. Maybe let's turn him around."

"Okay."

"We start here then. 
Move his hair away. 

Okay, then we can try and dislodge his spine. Put that at the base of his skull. Okay, can. You do. I'm going to pull down his pants and do this end."

"Very hard, leh."

"Try harder."

"Okay, done?"

_The ground is black and slick. They can turn him easily now._

"What do you see?"

"Cigarettes."

"Never see him smoke, leh."

"They're there."

"Where do you think he got them from?"

"Don't know. Don't keep them, they'll get us into trouble."

"His lungs are not very soft."

"Because of the cigarettes?"

"Don't know. Like it refuses to breathe."

"Push it aside. See what else is there."

"An open pocket knife."

"Open?"

"Open."

"Orh. And then?"

"I see an aviary. Parakeets, sparrows, an old cock. Green wires make the cage, rough gravel lines the ground. A small tree, ixora bushes. Old, dust covered.

Old newspapers.

A book about rabbits."

"All these, no use, leh."

"I know. Wait, larh."

"Open the stomach, see how?"

"Watches. All not working. Water, salty."

"Pee?"

"All the pee come out already, right?"

"Maybe."

"Maybe."

"Oh, I found a bottle."

"No use. Throw. All these, no use."

"His heart? You think we can get at his heart?"

"Must get it to stop beating first. Take this, poke it with it."

"It's too hard. This thing is not sharp enough."

"Try this one."

"Okay ... can. It's stopping."

"Okay, start from the left side. Slice there."

"... okay."

"What do you see?"

"Nothing, leh."

"Look harder."

"Sand."

"And then?"

"Bags of sand, and a space station. Empty, airless, unmanned. Maybe on autopilot, but can't tell, the heart has stopped beating.

Small old house; many rooms but doors with no locks. A ring of keys sit on the stairs at the hallway. Dusty bookshelves. A music box with no key."

"Books?"

"No books."

"No use."

"Then how?"

"No use, then throw."

"Too many things to throw."

"Then never mind. Really nothing else?"

"Don't know. It's very smelly."

"Never mind then."

"Yah."

"What's in his mouth?"

"In his mouth?"

"Yah. Why doesn't he say anything?"

"Don't know. What's in his mouth?"

"Open it."

"There's nothing."

"Really."

"Nothi- oh. Wait. Got one coin under his tongue."

"Our coin?"

"Not our coin."

"Never mind, can take."

"Okay."

"Okay."

"One more. Let's go find another one."

"Okay."
