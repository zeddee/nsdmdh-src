Can you stop doing that

she asked, hair on her skin just

beginning to settle after

being hoisted on their ends

when she turned around and saw him

suddenly there

pad footed not 

by nature but by being practised

at not being heard by his father who just wanted some

peace

but can you stop doing that she asked

for he scared her by not appearing to touch the ground with

the same weight that everybody else did

as if he were insubstantial and --Â 

he would quote --

_un revenant_.

an echo of something that was there before

but only before and not there then nor after

silhouette that is only there by virtue of peripheral light and would fade in focus

can you stop doing that

she asked

and most times he would just smile but 

all it took was once when he would not just smile but say

okay.
