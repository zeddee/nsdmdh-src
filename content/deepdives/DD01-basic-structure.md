A story can be understood as a sum of three parts: a beginning, middle, and end.

But that doesn't tell you much about what these parts do. Beginnings begin, middles middle, and ends end.

## The Structure

[Joseph Campbell's](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Hero-with-Thousand-Faces-Joseph-Campbell/9781577315933?a_aid=zeddified) version of this clarifies it a little: you begin with the birth of a hero (protagonist of choice), and the hero struggles against the villian. This struggle -- the stuff that the "middle" is made of -- will help the hero grow to realize a certain potential. The hero then defeats the villian as the final fulfilment of this potential.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse pullquote-right">The purpose of a story is to chart the fulfilment of potential.</blockquote>

[Northrop Frye](http://www.bookdepository.com/Anatomy-of-Criticism-Prof-Harold-Bloom-Northrop-Frye/9780691069999?a_aid=zeddified) turns to a more ancient formulation:

* _Agon_
* _Pathos_
* _Sparagmos_
* _Anagnorisis_ 

_Agon_ is the existential struggle of the protagonist -- he or she, when thrown into the story world, has to come into it with a struggle.

_Pathos_ is the presentation of a crisis or catastrophe, an oh-shit event that forces the protagonist to take action.

_Sparagmos_, Frye says, is sometimes left out of the story structure. It is the apparent (and temporary) failure of the protagonist to fulfil its potential. It is this failure that often spurs character growth, one that allows the protagonist to finally defeat the antagonist.

_Anagnorisis_ is not the defeat of the antagonist itself -- but the recognition of growth and fulfilled potential of the protagonist. The defeat of the antagonist by the protagonist, in this framework, is entirely optional. The focus is placed on the protagonist him or herself.

These are the points through which the thread of the story must weave through in order to produce our story -- according to Aristotle (in Frye), at least.

You'll never go wrong with sticking with the structure, and we'll see that in a later case study. But if you break down what's going on in Frye's and Campbell's set of story points, you'll find that story is essentially a structure of growth: the protagonist has to learn something along the way, and that's what the journey is for.

## Potential

Growth is still really vague. How about this: *The purpose of a story is to chart the fulfilment of potential*. The story is the rope that is, on one end, tied to the protagonist; the other end is tied to the protagonist's potential. The protagonist always pulls its potential towards it (or itself towards it), and its potential always pulls _away_ from it. The story ends when protagonist and potential meet. Sometimes, the protagonist loses its grip and its potential slips away. Sometimes it's a _danse macabre_, the two firmly connected by a strip of fabric twirling around each other until either or both are exhausted. No matter, it always comes down to the relationship between the protagonist and its potential.

So when writing your own story, you can decide to stick to Campbell's playbook and write an epic about slaying electronic dragons. Or not. But whatever story you tell, always remember that it comes down to only two things: 

**Who you are, and who you are going to be.**

## _UP_ and struggle

Pixar's _UP_ has a [sequence](https://youtu.be/F2bk_9T482g) that I frequently teach to my narrative classes. It's a perfect example of: 

1. how a story doesn't need a tangible antagonist, and 
2. how a story doesn't always have to end with a clear-cut win for the protagonist.

A word of warning: here, we're moving a little into abstract storytelling, where the protagonist and antagonist are not necessarily people or anthropomorphic/speaking characters themselves. It makes more sense to explain Carl and Ellie's story this way than placing Carl as the protagonist of this sequence (though he is ostensibly the protagonist for _UP_ itself).

The protagonist in question for the best 4 minutes of storytelling here is their marriage. This makes sense in two very obvious ways:

![](/img/deepdives/up/up-screen-01.jpg)

First, the obvious -- the sequence begins with Carl and Ellie's union, and ends at their separation (where Carl's own journey alone begins).

Second -- the entire sequence is about _where their marriage will go_, and not about either of them on their own. Here we see the elements of _agon_, _pathos_, _sparagmos_, and _anagnorisis_ come into play. 

The _agon_ or the existential struggle is the very quotidian work of getting a marriage to work -- building their home, setting up a business, and dealing with what life throws at them and who they are as a couple is the bass line that runs through not only their entire relationship but the story itself. _Pathos_ comes in several forms, the most poignant and salient of which is their visit to the doctor's office.

The emotional set up leading to the pulling of the rug from under the audience's feet is succinct, a fluid camera pan leading us from Carl and Ellie putting together the baby room to Carl's hands on the shoulders of a sobbing Ellie, framed by the sterile walls of the clinic. _Sparagmos_ is closely knitted to the _pathos_ here, a falling apart of the purpose and what they thought was the direction of the marriage. What follows is the protagonist's recovery. Carl hands Ellie their old book of Adventure, which becomes a talisman of sorts that pushes their journey forward.

They never got to Peru, of course. There is a second major moment of _pathos_ is when Ellie ends up in the hospital. Their second "baby" never comes to be — it could be said that the second half of the sequence is a series of miscarriages, that every smashing of the Adventure Fund is the stunting of their journey's fulfilment. Whether or not this story follows the structure of Greek tragedy is another issue of _Deep Dives_ altogether, but we can clearly sense the wasted potential here. What is curious though, is that we get a clear sense that Carl and Ellie's marriage has run its course, and that they've had a full life as companions. The sense of wasted potential actually comes mostly from the idea that Ellie never got to be the grown-up version of the adventurer we saw earlier.

The _anagnorisis_ hence comes from Ellie handing back Carl their book of Adventure. It is a wordless gesture of resignation -- by giving up the book as a talisman, she's telling Carl and the audience that she knows that she's never going to be able to make the trip. Her handing the book back is also her asking Carl to do what she could never do, and what they as partners were never able to do: to go on that adventure.

It is here that I would also like to add that Frye also says that the _agon_/_pathos_/_sparagmos_/_anagnorisis_ story structure is also cyclical -- that once one's potential is fulfilled, it makes room for another's path to emerge. In the case of _UP_, the 4 minutes of marriage (screen time, at least) that Carl and Ellie enjoyed is one such cycle that serves to flesh out Carl as a character, and set up his trajectory and motivation for that trajectory for the rest of the movie. This structure is also seen as a birth/death cycle, one that requires the ending of one story for the next to begin.
