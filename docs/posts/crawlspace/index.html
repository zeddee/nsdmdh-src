<p>&ldquo;<em>Zeh</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, why do you think that old man sits there all the time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s waiting for somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Just look like, only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he just doesn&rsquo;t want to stay at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t ask me already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go and ask him lah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. I don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Look. He&rsquo;s getting up. He&rsquo;s picking up all his newspapers. Maybe he knows that we see him, then he <em>paiseh</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not picking up his things. All the newspapers and cardboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is going. Maybe he&rsquo;s headed off to sit somewhere else, where there won&rsquo;t be people like us watching him. Maybe he&rsquo;s going to pee behind that tree, like he sometimes does. Maybe he has a home, and his nest of old papers is just for comfort, just convenient, just a reminder to stay connected to the earth and the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really meh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>They leave the balcony and scramble down the corridor of the apartment complex, turn right and down a flight of steps. It is noon, and there is one mynah perched on a brown rock. The children don&rsquo;t slow down as they approach the tree. The old man&rsquo;s penis peeks out of his pants, stream of urine tapering off. He doesn&rsquo;t see them as they bum-rush him.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>They&rsquo;re all on the ground. The old man is on his side, dampness spreading across the grass, the soil, his pants. He tries to roll.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, kick him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think can already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think he is carrying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, leh. See lor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he sees us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. His eyes are open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still peeing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not peeing already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very smelly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start here. Peel off that part under his collar bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do, lah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to get past his ribs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. You do, lah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cannot. Too hard. Maybe let&rsquo;s turn him around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We start here then.
Move his hair away.</p>

<p>Okay, then we can try and dislodge his spine. Put that at the base of his skull. Okay, can. You do. I&rsquo;m going to pull down his pants and do this end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very hard, leh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, done?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The ground is black and slick. They can turn him easily now.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never see him smoke, leh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you think he got them from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t keep them, they&rsquo;ll get us into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His lungs are not very soft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Like it refuses to breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Push it aside. See what else is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An open pocket knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orh. And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see an aviary. Parakeets, sparrows, an old cock. Green wires make the cage, rough gravel lines the ground. A small tree, ixora bushes. Old, dust covered.</p>

<p>Old newspapers.</p>

<p>A book about rabbits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these, no use, leh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. Wait, larh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the stomach, see how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watches. All not working. Water, salty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the pee come out already, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I found a bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use. Throw. All these, no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His heart? You think we can get at his heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must get it to stop beating first. Take this, poke it with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hard. This thing is not sharp enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay &hellip; can. It&rsquo;s stopping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, start from the left side. Slice there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&hellip; okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, leh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bags of sand, and a space station. Empty, airless, unmanned. Maybe on autopilot, but can&rsquo;t tell, the heart has stopped beating.</p>

<p>Small old house; many rooms but doors with no locks. A ring of keys sit on the stairs at the hallway. Dusty bookshelves. A music box with no key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Books?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use, then throw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many things to throw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then never mind. Really nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s very smelly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in his mouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his mouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah. Why doesn&rsquo;t he say anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. What&rsquo;s in his mouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothi- oh. Wait. Got one coin under his tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our coin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not our coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, can take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more. Let&rsquo;s go find another one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
