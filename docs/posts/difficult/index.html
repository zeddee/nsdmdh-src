<p>I turned thirty somewhere in the middle of this year. Joey Yap tells me via YouTube video that things will change this year. That&rsquo;s like saying we&rsquo;re all waiting to be stardust, but I&rsquo;ll take what I can get.</p>

<p>Other things that people say will happen when you turn thirty:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your finances are set. You&rsquo;ve bought a home; retirement&rsquo;s on the cards; your car&rsquo;s been paid for, etc. You&rsquo;ve just got to stick it out for another decade and you&rsquo;re good.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re getting married; the kid&rsquo;s already here, or a plan you&rsquo;re working towards.</li>
<li>Your parents are retired; it&rsquo;s your turn to support them now.</li>
<li>Your lifestyle is sane and productive. Your weekends are reserved for family and friends. You&rsquo;d hold a barbeque once in a while. Drinks on weekends, coffee for the rest of the week.</li>
</ul>

<p>If not already obvious, I have a penchant for difficult things and being difficult. I have done none of the above, not because they are not good things to have in one&rsquo;s life (and I am happy for my friends who have gotten life down pat), but because I need to be difficult. I cannot answer why nor what (re: what do you mean by &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;). I am, by no means, the most difficult, but nevertheless still difficult &ndash; difficult student, difficult team mate, difficult worker, difficult teacher, difficult brother, difficult son, difficult friend.</p>

<p>I will continue to be difficult, because I don&rsquo;t know any other way to exist.</p>
