<p>Can you stop doing that</p>

<p>she asked, hair on her skin just</p>

<p>beginning to settle after</p>

<p>being hoisted on their ends</p>

<p>when she turned around and saw him</p>

<p>suddenly there</p>

<p>pad footed not</p>

<p>by nature but by being practised</p>

<p>at not being heard by his father who just wanted some</p>

<p>peace</p>

<p>but can you stop doing that she asked</p>

<p>for he scared her by not appearing to touch the ground with</p>

<p>the same weight that everybody else did</p>

<p>as if he were insubstantial and &ndash;Â </p>

<p>he would quote &ndash;</p>

<p><em>un revenant</em>.</p>

<p>an echo of something that was there before</p>

<p>but only before and not there then nor after</p>

<p>silhouette that is only there by virtue of peripheral light and would fade in focus</p>

<p>can you stop doing that</p>

<p>she asked</p>

<p>and most times he would just smile but</p>

<p>all it took was once when he would not just smile but say</p>

<p>okay.</p>
